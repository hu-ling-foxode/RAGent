# RAGent
RAgent is a Discord bot designed to help users learn, summarize, and mine data within a Discord server using multimodal LLM and RAG systems. This project is an evolution of the llamabot project, with significant improvements and new features.

## LlamaBot

An open-source Discord bot, created using LlamaIndex, that -
- Listens to your server conversations
- Continuously learns from them
- Answers your questions from the entire server.

Itâ€™s recommended to host this bot yourself for your server, but if you wanna try out first, you can join this discord server and use RAGent through this link: https://discord.gg/sSkfGQHWk2

Tech stack used for this bot:
1. **LlamaIndex** as the RAG framework
2. **Openai** Pro as the LLm and Embedding model
3. **Qdrant cloud** as the vectorstore
4. **discord.py** to setup the bot logic
5. Finally deploy it to **Replit**
